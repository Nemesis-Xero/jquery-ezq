It has been released under version 3 of the GNU GPL. A copy of the license is included in this repository and also may be obtained here: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/\r\n\r\nAt its most simplistic level, it is a simple wrapper for the jQuery queue functionality. Some built-in features that make it stand out a bit:\r\n\r\n1. Much simpler and more familiar interface for jQuery's queue functionality\r\n2. Optional Auto-Delay between queued function calls\r\n3. Customizable logic defining when to continue while auto-delay is engaged\r\n4. Extensible without modification to the plugin's code\r\n\r\nThe options object passed to $.fn.ezq() is the final object in the $.extend() method call. Thus, any options passed in are given top priority. This means you can override members if you deem it necessary as well as adding completely new functionality, without having to modify the plugin file itself. Of course, you could just modify the plugin's file itself, but this can sometimes be faster and/or easier.","name":"Jquery-ezq"}
